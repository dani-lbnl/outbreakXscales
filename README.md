# OutbreakXscales
Surveillance from outbreak data across scales

## Data sources:
- geographical information, e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.
- web scrapping, e.g., scientific papers, websites
- social data, e.g., posts, tweets, pictures

## Data crunchers:
- Georeferencing data
- NLP, tm processing and visualization
- Imputation

## Pitching project Ideas:
- reuse/repurposing of ROpenSci, e.g., spocc?
- build capabilities not available in CDC [epi-info](https://epiinfo.codeplex.com/ "epi-info") or [openepi] (http://www.openepi.com/Menu/OE_Menu.htm "openepi")

## My notes: what might be important
- Web-based graphs (e.g. htmlwidgets, shiny, google charts). 
- Data formating, json, etc
- Vector borne diseases and specific demands, e.g., vector identification
- Inheriting ROpenSci software stack for data visualization as part of web-apps
- How to deploy data understanding pipelines for epidemiology?
- How to integrate different sources of data?
- This repo is part of the activities developed within ROpenSci [hackathon](http://hackout3.ropensci.org/ "hackathon")
